### 1.2: Run QuickNotes

In one terminal

```
❯ cd app/
go run .
2026/06/09 18:57:05 quicknotes listening on :8080 (notes loaded: 4)
```

In another terminal

```
❯ curl -s http://localhost:8080/health | python3 -m json.tool
{
    "notes": 4,
    "status": "ok"
}
❯ curl -s http://localhost:8080/notes  | python3 -m json.tool

    }
]
```

### 1.3: Configure SSH Signing

I configured those using nix:

```
{
  programs.git = {
    enable = true;

    ignores = [
      ".DS_Store"
      ".cursor"
      ".idea"
      ".vscode"
      "shell.nix"
    ];

    settings = {
      user = {
        name = "Timofey Sedov";
        email = "moflotas@gmail.com";
      };

      # for ssh signing of commits
      gpg.format = "ssh";
      user.signingkey = "~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub";
      commit.gpgsign = true;
      tag.gpgsign = true;

      push.autoSetupRemote = "true";

      core.editor = "nvim";
    };
  };
}
```

After rebuilding the system here are the contents of `~/.config/git/config`

```
❯ cat ~/.config/git/config
[commit]
	gpgsign = true

[core]
	editor = "nvim"

[gpg]
	format = "ssh"

[push]
	autoSetupRemote = "true"

[tag]
	gpgsign = true

[user]
	email = "moflotas@gmail.com"
	name = "Timofey Sedov"
	signingkey = "~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub"
```

I added the key to github

### 1.4: Make a Signed Commit

```
❯ git switch -c feature/lab1
Switched to a new branch 'feature/lab1'
❯ mkdir -p submissions
❯ echo "# Lab 1 submission" >> submissions/lab1.md
❯ git add submissions/lab1.md
❯ git commit -S -s -m "docs(lab1): start submission"
[feature/lab1 acbe658] docs(lab1): start submission
 2 files changed, 204 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 submissions/images/lab1/01-signed-key.png
 create mode 100644 submissions/lab1.md
 ```

Verify the signature locally:

```
❯ git log --show-signature -1
